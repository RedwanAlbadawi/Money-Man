# Mapping Unclaimed Security Deposits in the city of toronto
based off of the clusterpoint map demo

This project is using Clusterpoint Rest API to request data from our
Open street map database copy.

The data used is parsed from the City of Toronto OpenData initiative. The data is stored with the help of a clusterpoint database.

Google's Geocoding service is used to convert data to latlngs

Leaflet.js was used in the sidebar, layers and markers

Mapbox.js was used in designing the map ( used one of their templates with my own style adjustments)
